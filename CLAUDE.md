# CLAUDE.md — CraftlyAI Project Context

Last updated: 2026-05-10
Current phase: Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–3)

---

## What this project is

CraftlyAI is an AI-powered operating system for freelancers, creatives, developers, and small agencies. It replaces fragmented tools (invoicing, CRM, time tracking, client portals) with a single app where AI does the heavy lifting invisibly in the background.

North star: every interaction should save the user at least 10 minutes. If it doesn't, it shouldn't exist.

Web app first (Next.js 15 App Router) → mobile (Expo, Phase 4) → desktop (Tauri, Phase 5 if warranted).

Target user at launch: solo freelancers earning $2,000–$15,000/month in tech, design, or content. Based in UAE, UK, US, MENA. English-language only at launch.

| PDF | React-PDF + pdf-lib | Pixel-perfect output |
| Charts | Recharts | Lightweight, MIT license |
| Icons | Lucide React | |
| Animation | Framer Motion | Transitions only; micro-interactions in CSS |
| Backend | Supabase | Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Email + magic link + Google OAuth. JWT tokens. |
| AI API | Anthropic Claude API | Haiku (routing/fast), Sonnet (docs), Opus (monthly strategy) |
| Agent runtime | Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) | All AI calls here. Never from browser or Next.js API routes. |
| Email | Resend | Transactional. 3,000/month free. |
| Payments (user billing) | Lemon Squeezy | Merchant of Record — handles global VAT. Switch to Stripe at $5k MRR. |

## Naming conventions

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files | kebab-case | `client-form.tsx` |
| Component exports | PascalCase | `export function ClientForm` |
| DB tables | snake_case plural | `clients`, `line_items` |
| TypeScript types | PascalCase | `Client`, `Project`, `Document` |
| Hooks | useNoun | `useClients`, `useProjects` |
| Server actions | verbNoun | `createClient`, `updateProject` |
| Edge Functions | kebab-case | `document-writer/index.ts` |

---

## Coding patterns — ALWAYS follow these

- **Data fetching:** server components only. No `useEffect` for data fetching ever.
- **Mutations:** server actions in `actions.ts` co-located per feature folder.
- **Forms:** react-hook-form + Zod. No uncontrolled inputs.
- **Client components:** only when strictly necessary (event handlers, browser APIs, `useEffect` for UI only).
- **AI calls:** only from Supabase Edge Functions. Never from Next.js API routes or the browser.
- **Auth checks:** server component or middleware. Never client-side only.
- **Streaming:** all AI responses stream to UI via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Never block UI waiting for full response.
- **RLS:** every Supabase table has Row Level Security. Users can only access their own data.

## Coding patterns — NEVER do these

- Never use `any` type
- Never fetch in `useEffect` (use server components)
- Never put business logic in `page.tsx` — keep pages as thin shells
- Never call Claude API from the browser or a Next.js API route
- Never use inline styles (Tailwind only)
- Never modify files in `components/ui/` — shadcn/ui owns those
- Never write DB schema changes in code — always write a migration file
- Never continue old Claude.ai chats — start fresh each session, paste this file first

## AI agent fleet

| Agent | Model | Tier | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Router | claude-haiku-4-5 | All | Receives every Cmd+K input, classifies intent, delegates to specialist |
| 1 — Document Writer | claude-sonnet-4-6 | All | Generates proposals, quotes, invoices, contracts from brief |
| 2 — Finance Analyst | claude-haiku-4-5 | All | Revenue Q&A, cashflow summaries, anomaly detection |
| 3 — Communication Drafter | claude-haiku-4-5 | Starter+ | Follow-up emails, reply suggestions, tone matching |
| 4 — Project Intelligence | claude-haiku-4-5 | Starter+ | Daily digest, risk scoring, deadline warnings |
| 5 — Relationship Manager | claude-haiku-4-5 | Starter+ | Client health scores, churn signals, check-in suggestions |
| 6 — Pricing Advisor | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Pro only | Scope analysis, market rate recommendations |
| 7 — Business Strategist | claude-opus-4-6 | Pro only | Monthly strategic briefing — used once/month per user max |

**Cost target:** ~$0.50–$2.00/active user/month. 80% of requests go to Haiku. Opus runs batch, once monthly.

**Caching:** Supabase stores agent outputs with TTL. Same question in same session returns cached response. Context compression: each agent receives only the data it needs, not the full database.

## Plan tiers

| Tier | Price | Key limits |
|---|---|---|
| Free | $0 | 3 clients, 5 docs/month, 2 templates, 20 AI actions/month (Router + Doc Writer only) |
| Starter | $19/mo ($15 annual) | 15 clients, unlimited docs, agents 1–4, 100 AI actions/month |
| Pro | $49/mo ($39 annual) | Unlimited everything, all agents 0–7, custom portal domain, API access |
| Agency | $99/mo ($79 annual) | Pro + 5 team members, shared workspace, white-label portal |

Plan gating: Supabase RLS + middleware check plan tier before every AI call.

## Database tables (core)

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| users | id, email, full_name, plan_tier, plan_expires_at, brand_kit_id |
| brand_kits | id, user_id, logo_url, primary_color, secondary_color, font, email_signature |
| clients | id, user_id, name, email, phone, company, address, currency, notes, health_score |
| projects | id, user_id, client_id, title, status, budget, spent, start_date, deadline |
| tasks | id, project_id, title, status, due_date, priority |
| documents | id, user_id, client_id, project_id, type, status, content_json, pdf_url, sent_at, viewed_at, signed_at |
| line_items | id, document_id, description, quantity, unit_price, tax_rate, amount |
| payments | id, document_id, amount, currency, method, paid_at |

| notifications | id, user_id, type, payload, read_at, action_taken_at |
| subscriptions | id, user_id, lemon_squeezy_id, plan, status, current_period_end |

All tables: `created_at`, `updated_at`, and RLS enabled. Users only read/write their own rows.

## Known issues / gotchas

- [ ] (add as discovered)

---

## Last session summary

- 2026-05-10: Project initialized. Folder structure scaffolded for v2. CLAUDE.md written. No code yet.

---

## Tool split rules (respect these)

- **Claude.ai:** architecture decisions, schema design, agent prompts, TypeScript types, Zod schemas, server action logic, Edge Function first drafts, code review (max 80 lines). Fresh chat every session — paste this file first.
- **Cursor:** all file editing, component building, debugging, installing packages, wiring Supabase to UI, Tailwind fixes. Open the full project folder, never paste files into Claude.ai when Cursor can read them directly.
- **Cowork:** updating this file, organizing /docs and /assets, drafting marketing copy, writing feature specs to /docs/specs/, weekly reviews, scheduled reminders. Never touches code files.
